As we kick off the spring semester, Catalyst members have been hard at work on several exciting research initiatives. Here's a snapshot of what's happening.

## Materials Science: Thin Film Analysis

A team of three members is studying the optical properties of thin-film coatings using spectrophotometry. The goal is to characterize how different deposition methods affect light transmission and reflectivity — work that has direct applications in solar cell technology.

## Computational Biology: Protein Folding Simulations

Two members are running molecular dynamics simulations to explore protein folding pathways. Using open-source tools like GROMACS, they're investigating how temperature and pH influence the stability of small peptides.

## Data Science: Campus Sustainability Audit

In partnership with DVC's sustainability committee, a group of Catalyst members is collecting and analyzing energy usage data across campus buildings. They plan to present recommendations for reducing the college's carbon footprint at the end of the semester.

## What's Next

We'll be presenting preliminary results at DVC's Student Research Symposium in April. If you'd like to join a project or start your own, come to our next meeting — new collaborators are always welcome.
