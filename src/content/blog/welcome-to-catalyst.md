We're excited to officially launch **Catalyst**, Diablo Valley College's newest STEM research club! Our mission is simple: bring together curious, driven students who want to explore scientific frontiers and build meaningful careers in STEM fields.

## What We Do

Catalyst is more than a club — it's a launchpad. Here's what you can expect:

- **Research Projects**: Collaborative hands-on research in physics, chemistry, biology, and interdisciplinary fields.
- **Workshops & Seminars**: Regular sessions covering lab techniques, data analysis, scientific writing, and more.
- **Guest Lectures**: Hear from professionals and researchers working at the cutting edge of their fields.
- **Networking**: Connect with peers, mentors, and industry contacts who share your passion.

## Why Catalyst?

Community colleges are brimming with talented, motivated students who often lack the research opportunities available at four-year institutions. Catalyst exists to change that. We believe every student deserves the chance to engage with real science, regardless of where they start.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a first-semester student curious about research or a seasoned lab veteran, there's a place for you at Catalyst. Drop by our meetings in **PL 101** or reach out at [catalyst@dvc.edu](mailto:catalyst@dvc.edu).

Let's build something great together.
